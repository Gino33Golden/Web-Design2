<p>I will be giving my thoughts on The Dallas Cowboys 2019-2020 Season</p>

<h3 class="logo1">New York Giants Vs. Dallas Cowboys</h3>

        <p>
            Before the season started, Cowboys fans, myself included, had high expetations for America's Team. We've seen a defence that really held there own throughout the season with some fan-favorite players leading the charge. The offence on the other hand was a dissapointment. Until Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones traded for WR Amari Copper which completly flipped the season around. After failing to sign free agent S Earl Thomas we went into the 2019 season with the same roster. Some notable off-season aditions were: WR Randall Cobb, DE Robert Quinn, and new OC Kellen More. We also got to see the re-signing of Demarcus Lawrence and the end of a holdout in Exikel Elliot. We also got to see TE Jason Witten come out of retirement to help with the leadership in the locker room. As I was watching Week 1 of the 2019 season, I could see that we lost something in our defence. However, the offence was out of this world. We scored 5 touchdowns on 5 straight drives to push us past the New York Giants. We did have a slow start giving up a huge play to Giants RB Saquon Barkley but we quickly answered back with a toushdown. After that, it was a party for the fans at AT&T Stadium. Kellen Moore had a really good coaching debut and is a huge up-grade from Scott Lineahan. Jason Witten had a toushdown catch, Amari Cooper had a touchdown, Randall Cobb had a touchdown, and Micheal Gallup had a touchdown. Amari Cooper and Micheal Galuup went over 100 yards and Dak had one of his best games yet. Now, if we get our defence straighten out, we are going much further into the play-offs than anyother year under HC Jason Garrett. All in all, in was a great game to watch (for Cowboy's fans)and hopefully there will be many more victories in the future.

<h3 class="logo1">Dallas Cowboys Vs. New England Patriots</h3>
    <img class="Dallas" src="https://www.betnow.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dallas-Cowboys-vs-New-England-Patriots-11-24-2019-Spread-Predictions-and-Game-Analysis.jpg" alt=NewEnglandPatriots>
<p>In very bad weather, the Dallas Cowboys were set to face off the New England Patriots in week 11 of the 2019-2020 NFL season. As I said before, it was very bad conditions with hard rain and cold weather. The final score of the game was 13-9 Patriots but it wasn't a perfect game on both teams, including the referees. First, I will give the run down for the game on the Cowboys sideline. We scored all of our points by K Brett Maher but he did miss one field goal. The offence was terrible and looked like the offence when we had Tony Romo but without him. Yeah, that bad. We did come close to scoring a few times but it was called back from a tripping call. <b>I'm going to get to that later.</b> Randall Cobb had an OK game ending with 4 catches for 86 yards, Michael Gallup had 4 catches for 55 yards and Amari Cooper had... 0 catches. First time ever as a Cowboy. Now, lets flip to the other side of the ball. The defence finnaly showed up even though we were not playing with LB Leighton Vander Esch. Some can argue that the weather did most of the defencive work for us, and I totally agree. Although we had a few good plays like run stopping by Jaylon Smith and that tremendous hit by S Jeff Heath which forced fourth down. We talked about the Cowboys, lets flip over to the Patriots. They didn't have a good game either but did go home with a win.</p>

    <h2>2020 NFL Season</h2>
    <h3>Dallas Cowboys Vs. Los Angeles Rams</h3>
    <img class="Dallas" src="https://www.valleycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2019/01/CowboysRams_1546901685435_66784690_ver1.0.jpg?w=640"
	    <p>I am sad and dissapointed in this team...</p>

	<h3>Atlanta Falcons Vs. Dallas Cowboys</h3>
        <img class="Dallas" src="https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/ye1wmm4nojze9izktbxf"
	        <p>In the begining of the game, it looked like all hope was lost. Six fumbles and four of them were lost. The team looked sloopy, unorginized, and didn't even want to play. Except one man: Dak Prescott. He did have a fumble in the begining, but eventually made up for it at the end of the game. Our offensive line was beat up, missing both of our star tackles (Tyron Smith and La'el Collin) to injury. If you are a Cowboy's fan, you probably didn't even watch the game until the second half. The Cowboys were down by 20 points, but we all know the Atlanta Falcons are known for chocking leads.(28-3) Dak Prescott led the team from 20 down with over 500 yards and three rushing touchdowns to set up a game winning feild goal to win 40-39. That's not all, probably the most memorable moment in this game was... the onside kick. Dallas had less than a 1% chance to get the onside kick, but thanks to the Atlanta Falcons players not knowing the rules, the Cowboys were able to recover and win. It was a great win and hopefully there is more to come.</p>

	        <p>I have no words of what happened... If you watched the game or gone onto any social media accounts, you know that Dak Prescott broke his ankle and is out for the season. It is something no one wants to see, but unfortunetly is apart of the game. If you put the injury aside, the defence looked awful(again) even though they did have a score. Demarcus Lawrence finally got a sack, but we all expected it because he is going against a rookie tackle and tackling a turnover-prone quaterback. If you are an Nfl fan not caring about the outcome, it was a great game to watch with a lot of exciting plays. Some of them got called back(thanks again Cameron Flemming) but both sides still found a way to score. </p>

    <h3>Arizona Cardnials Vs. Dallas Cowboys</h3>

            <p>What a terrible game. This is the first full game without Dak Prescott and it went as people expected. The offence couldn't move the ball and the defence was even worse than last week. I would think that the defensive coorinator would see the whole and try to fix them for next week, but it looked like he took a day off.</p>
